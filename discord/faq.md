# FAQ

This channel contains answers frequently asked questions we see. If your question isn't answered in this channel, take a peek at our docs site online: <https://littlebigrefresh.github.io/Docs/>

## Q: Does Refresh have a public server?

No, LittleBigRefresh has no public server currently. We plan to spin one up soon, so stay tuned.

## Q: How do I use Refresh?

You can download the latest release from our GitHub. It's as easy as extracting a .zip to a comfortable spot, and running it.

Refresh can't update itself, although we announce new releases in <#1049226545916551188>

Patching isn't quite documented yet, but we recommend you use Refresher or UnionPatcher to do this.

## Q: When will Refresh be complete?

It's tough to say, but we're making steady progress. We try to post updates by means of releasing new versions of Refresh, but if you're extra curious you can watch the development channels. (particularly <#1102426423240691712> and <#1049225857350254632>)

## Q: What are Bunkum and Refresher?

Bunkum is the name of the server software that runs Refresh - developed by us. It's designed to be easier to use than ASP.NET, while allowing flexibility for games that do strange things.

It was born out of frustration when LBP kept violating several internet standards - as a result Bunkum will be more lenient than other servers with these.

Refresher is the patcher that lets you modify your game to connect to custom servers. It can technically work for other games than just the LBP series, but it is still a work in progress.

It aims to be smart, communicating with the server for proper patching instructions via our "Autodiscover" protocol.
