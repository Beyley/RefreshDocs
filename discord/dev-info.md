# Welcome to the Refresh Development section!

Here you can find discussions between developers working on Refresh.

You may notice that these channels are locked.
This isn't meant to gate-keep anyone from contributing, it's meant to keep the discussion on-topic and filter out unwanted noise.
 
# How do I gain access?

If you are a developer whose interested in contributing to these discussions, feel free to ping <@956347815267827713> in any channel (or send a DM) with your GitHub account link.

Alternatively, you can try out Discord's new Linked Roles feature to link your GitHub account and gain access.

![Server Settings dropdown -> Linked Roles](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleBigRefresh/Docs/main/discord/dev-info-dropdown.png)
![Linked Roles modal](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LittleBigRefresh/Docs/main/discord/dev-info-connect-account.png)

In general, you should avoid privately messaging other developers to keep all discussions in one place.

# Security

If you're here to report a security vulnerability, Discord is not the place.

You should use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature - this is enabled on all of our projects under the security tab.

For Refresh, this accessible at <https://github.com/LittleBigRefresh/Refresh/security>.

# I just want to watch development progress!

There's no need to do anything; you already have read access to all channels!
